# RandomForestClassifier-From-Scratch
A beginner-friendly implementation of Random Forest Classifier using Python and scikit-learn. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, label encoding, model training, prediction, and visualization of individual decision trees using a simple weather–play dataset.
Random Forest Classifier Project
Implemented a Random Forest Classifier using Python and scikit-learn. The project includes data preprocessing, label encoding, model training, prediction, and visualization of individual decision trees.
This helped me understand ensemble learning and how Random Forest improves performance over a single decision tree. 🌳
